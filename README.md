This *Tennis for Two* recreation was developed for [*A Whole Different Ball Game: Playing Through 60 Years of Sports Video Games*](http://movingimage.us/exhibitions/2018/09/14/detail/a-whole-different-ball-game-playing-through-60-years-of-sports-video-games/) at [Museum of the Moving Image](http://movingimage.us). It is adapted from [code and tutorial by Windell Oskay of Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/resurrecting-tennis-for-two-a-video-game-from-1958/) and benefited from [a tutorial about digital-to-analog converters by Amanda Ghassei](https://www.instructables.com/id/Stereo-Audio-with-Arduino/).

## Hardware Requirements
* 1x [Dumont 304-A oscilloscope](https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/dumont_la_oscilloscope_304_a304.html)
* 1x [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano)
* 1x [TLC7528 dual 8-bit DAC](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/TLC7528CN/296-1871-5-ND/277516)
* 2x [10K linear potentiometers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/562)
* 2x [knobs](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/te-connectivity-alcoswitch-switches/PKB90B1-4/450-1730-ND/1201515)
* 2x [buttons](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/e-switch/PS1040ARED/EG2035-ND/53842)
* 3x [aluminum boxes](https://www.amazon.com/HAMMOND-1550E-ENCLOSURE-INSTRUMENT-ALUMINIUM/dp/B005T8PW1K/)
* 2x [10K resistors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2784)
* 3x [banana plug cables](https://www.amazon.com/Elenco-Banana-Test-Lead-Set/dp/B0002JJU4Q/)
* 1x [proto board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/571)
* 3x [small cable glands](https://www.adafruit.com/product/762)
* 3x [large cable glands](https://www.adafruit.com/product/761)

## Future Improvements
* Evaluate higher resolution DACs. The current 8-bit DAC only creates a resolution of 256x256 "pixels". This would require more research, but the larger resolution of a higher bit DAC may simulate the original Tennis for Two with more fidelity.
* Simulate the clicking sound of relay switches with sound files.
